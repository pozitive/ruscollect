    - "International Legal Agency was created in 1994 to help Chinese, American, and

      debts from Russian citizens who have defaulted on loans or committed other deceitful
      acts. \r\n\r\n\r\nPictured above are just a few of our employees who work tirelessly

      cultures which help us relate to our clients and their needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe

    - ENTREPRENUERS WHO HAVE LOST MONEY IN RUSSIA
    - ''
    - ''
    - "The Russian Government is not very supportive of foreign debtors trying to
      collect from Russian citizens. Because of this, you need to do everything possible
      to help yourself by hiring a professional, experienced law firm who can help
      you navigate the complicated bureaucracy. The International Legal Agency has
      over twenty years of experience recovering lost money and goods from Russian
      citizens. \r\nWe can also help prevent any problems before they arise by aiding
      in business transactions and preparing all of the necessary documents to protect
      your assets. Consult with a Russian legal firm before investing money with any
      Russian companies or in any Russian based projects. Take a look below at some
      examples of what happened to people who didn’t bother seeking professional legal
      advice before investing. \r\n\r\n### CASE 1\r\n\r\nForeign entrepreneurs bought
      roughly $5 million worth of goods without documents proving purchase of, or
      taxes paid, on the products. The police were tipped off by the Russian businessmen
      who sold the goods and they came to take all the products for failure to pay
      taxes. The foreign entrepreneurs wrote a complaint to Prime Minister of Russia,
      but to no avail. Because the foreign entrepreneurs did not have the correct
      documents they were unable to get their money or their goods returned. If they
      had hired a lawyer before investing, they would have been advised on the necessary
      documents and their troubles could have been avoided. \r\n\r\n\r\n### CASE 2\r\n\r\nA
      Chinese business man transferred $50,000 to a known Russian con man by the name
      of Toll Bychkovski for the preparation and delivery of legal work permits. The
      business man was provided with a pledge document for the work permits. The permits
      were never delivered and the Chinese business man turned to the authorities
      to have the money returned. Unfortunately, according to Russian law, a pledge
      is non-refundable no matter the outcome of the transaction. If the Chinese business
      man had consulted with a lawyer before handing over the money, he would have
      been advised that a pledge is non-refundable and does not provide any security
      or promise of delivery. Always consult with a lawyer before investing large
      sums of money in any business transaction in Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CASE 3\r\n\r\nA
      foreign business man was found in Madame Zhao Lin Hotel on Panfilov Street in
      Moscow with $1.5 million in his hotel room. The police took the money as the
      business man did not have any documents proving ownership of the money or how
      it was brought into the country. He was also forced by the police to sign a
      document in Russian that he could not read. Afterwards, he hired our services
      to recoup his money, but as he did not have any of the necessary documents,
      we were only able to recover a portion of the money. Had he not signed the police
      documents, he may have been able to get the necessary documents proving his
      ownership from his accountant at a later date to recoup a greater amount or
      all of his money. Never sign any contracts in Russia that you cannot read as
      you may be waiving rights to your money or goods. Remember the police in Russia
      are known for their corruption. \r\n\r\n\r\n### CASE 4\t\r\n\r\nA business woman
      imported 500 coolers to Russia for a cost of $23,000. She then rented storage
      space in a warehouse at the factory “Mirrors” in Moscow. She paid rent for six
      months and went to China to conduct other business. When she returned the warehouse
      was empty. The warehouse director denied ever having any coolers stored in the
      warehouse. She had documents proving that she had the right to use the warehouse
      for six months, but no documents proving coolers were ever delivered. She was
      unable to recoup her lost goods as she did not have the correct documents. If
      she had consulted with a Russian lawyer, they could have advised her on the
      required documents to ensure safe storage of her goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CONCLUSION
      \r\n\r\nExecute documents at every stage of a business transaction and contact
      a licensed Russian lawyer familiar with doing business in Russia before investing
      any large sums of money!"

    - HOW TO ORDER RETURN OF MONEY OR GOODS LOST IN RUSSIA
    - ''
    - ''
    - "Business transactions in foreign countries are complicated and problems can
      arise quickly. When dealing with honest people, a mutually satisfactory settlement
      can often be reached, but when dealing with unscrupulous people legal recourse
      is often necessary. Don’t let yourself be scammed. Hire the services of a reputable
      law firm to protect you assets. \r\nIf you are having problems recovering lost
      or stolen money in Russia we can help! Our law firm handles all forms of international
      debt dispute, debt litigation, and debt collection. \r\n\r\nAfter contacting
      our firm and discussing the details of your Russian debt collection problem,
      we will determine how we can help. Once a contract is signed, we will get to
      work reclaiming your lost money! \r\n\r\nThe ability of our law firm to recover
      your funds lost in Russia depends upon your documents. Based on Russian debt
      dispute laws, if you do not have valid documents showing proof of your claim
      to the money or goods, you will not be able to take any action. \r\n\r\nWe can
      handle the entire debt collection process for you through e-mail and over the
      phone allowing you to avoid any costly trips to Russia. Let the International
      Legal Agency help you recover your lost money today!\r\n\r\nNECESSARY DOCUMENTS
      FOR RECOVERY OF LOST MONEY OR GOODS\r\n\r\n1. Receipt, sales slip, loan documents,
      or some other legal document realted to your product or business dealings. \r\n\r\n2.
      Documents on the Russian Company or national such as a BIN (company registration
      number), TIN (tax identification number), or passport copy.\r\n\r\n3. A photo
      of the Russian, while not required, can often be helpful. We can distribute
      it through our network to help expedite the process and make it easier to find
      the swindler. We also compile listings of fraudulent Russian businessmen to
      help inform others. \r\n\r\nAs long as you have the necessary documents, the
      International Legal Agency can help reclaim your lost money and goods!\r\n\r\n###
      PAYMENT OPTIONS\r\n\r\nBank Transfer – Money can be transferred in rubles, RMB,
      or US dollars. \r\nOur fees vary from 40,000 rubles to 1,000,000 rubles based
      on the complexity of your case and the location of your debtor.\r\n\r\n### OUR
      PROCESS\r\n\r\nWe begin by collecting information on your debtor and their company.
      First we research property and financial information which can help during the
      negotiation and settlement process of your debt collection. After our research
      is completed, we contact your debtor and work to agree on debt settlement terms.
      \r\n\r\nIf a mutually agreeable settlement cannot be reached, we start an appeals
      process in the Russian courts. Our law firm will handle the court proceedings
      to obtain a judgment against your defaulter. Once a favorable judgment has been
      obtained, the Russian courts will aide us in reclaiming your money. If there
      have been severe financial or other crimes, there is a possibility of raising
      criminal charges as well. "

    - "Sometimes the best route to recouping your lost money is through a joint collaboration
      with the Russian Police Department and a licensed Russian lawyer. If the crime
      committed has caused significant damages and can be proven, there is a possibility
      of having the swindler jailed for his deeds. When including the police, it is
      doubly important to ensure that you have all of the necessary documents proving
      your claim to the lost money or goods. Without the correct paperwork, neither
      the police nor our law firm will be able to help. Involving the police should
      be a last resort when all other means have failed as the complicated bureaucracy
      lengthens the time needed to reclaim your assets. \r\n\r\nEven with the help
      of the police, it is vital that you hire a licensed lawyer who is familiar with
      the process and Russian laws. They can help prepare all the required documents
      and facilitate communications with the police. \r\n"

    - "\r\nWe provide our services under a Power of Attorney agreement.\r\n\r\nWhen
      processing the agreement, the Russian notary will ask three questions.\r\n1.
      What is the length of Power of Attorney Contract? (Maximum three years)\r\n2.
      Does the Power of Attorney include the right of substitution? \r\n3. Does the
      Power of Attorney include the right to receive and transfer money or property
      without additional consent?\r\nPower of Attorney to represent the interests
      of clients abroad is handled differently. Following is the procedure for a trustee
      to represent client’s interest abroad.\r\n\r\nFIRST ORDER – As long as Russia
      and the country in question have signed a treaty on legal assistance, everything
      is very simple and straightforward. After signing the authorization form from
      our Russian notary, our staff will enter the country in question to represent
      your interests. Our employees will then translate the authorization form into
      the local language where it will once again be notarized. With the Power of
      Attorney issued by a Russian notary and a local notary in the country of question,
      we can begin to work on collecting your debt abroad. This prevents you from
      having to travel to another country yourself to work on collecting the debt.
      \r\n\r\nSECOND ORDER – If there is no legal treaty between Russia and the country
      in question, we will still need a Power of Attorney form notarized in Russia.
      We will then work on obtaining a Power of Attorney for registration in foreign
      embassies based on the following:\r\n\r\n1. Valid passport \r\n2. Translated
      and notarized copy of Russian Power of Attorney\r\n3. Tax identification number

    - "We’ve put together a reference of useful tips to help guide you while getting
      your business venture started in Russia. \r\n\r\n### RUSSIAN OFFICIALS\r\n\r\nDealing
      with Russian Officials is difficult due to the high level of corruption. Your
      troubles may even start while you are trying to get a visa before you have ever
      entered the country. If you haven’t done all of the paperwork correctly, and
      sometimes even if you have, you may have trouble getting the visa or crossing
      the border once you have one. \r\nYou’ll also have to meet with many Russian
      officials while setting up your business and deal with the Federal Migration
      Service as well. Your best bet is to work through an intermediary familiar with
      the process and can facilitate everything while keeping costs to a minimum.
      Russian officials have been known to demand ludicrous bribes from foreign business
      men establishing a company.\r\n\r\n\r\n### RUSSIAN CUSTOMS\r\n\r\nRussian customs
      are very strict with planes arriving from China and will thoroughly inspect
      passengers and their bags. Do not try and hide and illicit goods or try and
      bring any items trough undeclared. We have many clients who have been detained
      by customs and come to us for help in sorting everything out.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nA
      Chinese woman was caught trying to smuggle amber inside her panties. She was
      fined 3 million rubles.\r\n\r\nA Chinese student tried to smuggle mobile phones
      under his t-shirt and was fined 1.5 million rubles.\r\nOnce caught trying to
      smuggle undocumented goods into the country, there is nothing we can do to help
      and, if convicted or fined, you will not be allowed into Russia for three years.\r\n\r\n\r\n###
      FMS - Federal Migration Service\r\n\r\nThe Federal Migration Service can be
      a big problem for foreigners entering the country or trying to establish a business.
      As long as all of your documents are in order, you shouldn’t have any problems,
      but the FMS is known for its corruption and they earn a lot of money by imposing
      trumped up fines on foreign owned companies or companies employing foreigners.

      RUSSIAN POLICE\r\n\r\nForeigners are often treated with suspicion by the Russian
      police and usually disrespect as well. If you find yourself in a situation where
      you need the assistance of the Russian police, we recommend you use the service
      of a licensed Russian lawyer to help. With the support of a Russian lawyer,
      the Russian police are more likely to treat you fairly and help you with any
      claims without trying to ask for excessive bribes. \r\n\r\nIf you need to the
      aid of the Russian police, contact us first and we will help. \r\n\r\n### STSI
      - Russian Traffic Police or DPS – Road Inspection Service\r\n\r\nIf driving
      yourself around Russia, it is inevitable that you will be dealing with the STSI
      or DPS at some point. The best thing you can do is ensure that all of your documents
      are driving permits are in order. Even with all of the required paperwork, they
      will make up violations to extort money out of you in the form of small bribes.
      \r\n\r\n\r\n### RUSSIAN COURTS\r\n\r\nAs long as you have your documents in
      order, the Russian courts can be a very strong ally, but they are also very
      bureaucratic and you will need the support of a Russian lawyer familiar with
      the process. With the aid of a Russian lawyer and the correct documents proving
      your claims, there is a very good chance the Russian courts will side in your
      favor.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### RUSSIAN CITIZENS COME FROM A VARIETY NATIONALITIES\r\n\r\nRussia
      is home to a variety of cultures and ethnicities who speak a number of different
      languages. We have compiled a small reference of some of the nationalities you
      might deal with while doing business in Russia.  \r\n\r\n### ARMENIAN –\r\n\r\nThe
      Armenian people have a very interesting culture and are very outgoing. Many
      of them are involved in the job market and vendors in the Russian markets. Unfortunately,
      they have a reputation for cheating foreign business men. This does not apply
      to the educated Armenians such as doctors and artists, but rather the poorer
      or uneducated. There is also an Armenian mafia you need to be wary of while
      doing business with them in Russia, but unlike many mafias, they are not very
      aggressive or violent. Your biggest risk when doing business with Armenians
      is fraud.   \r\n\r\n### AZERBAIJANIS –\r\n\r\nAzerbaijanis are very similar
      to Turkish people in language and customs, but have an outwardly oriental appearance.
      outwardly look like oriental people. They are very friendly, enterprising folk
      who can usually be found working in the markets or driving taxis. As with most
      nationalities in Russia, there is an Azeri mafia, but surprisingly they often
      conduct business fairly as long as you are cautious in your dealings.\r\n\r\n###
      CHECHENS –\r\n\r\nChechens have a very bad reputation in Russia as one of the
      most dangerous nationalities to deal with. They have committed many brutal crimes
      and the Chechnyan government is not supportive of businessmen trying to recoup
      their lost money from Chechen con men. You would do well to avoid doing any
      business with Chechens while in Russia or its neighboring countries.  \r\n\r\n\r\n###
